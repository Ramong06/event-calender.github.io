# homework05.event-calender.github.io

This homework assignment was assigned to me by The University of Texas at University of Houston Coding Bootcamp.  
The purpose of this assignment is for me utilize JQuery to have an event calender that:
1. Saves event styped into the event boxes to the local storage. 
2. Shows the events that have passed, are currently active and will be active in the future.
3. Use colors to highlight events past, present and future.
